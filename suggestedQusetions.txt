why did you choose Python instead of C# :

C# support in unix and BSD OS's is weak , python comes already loaded inside ubuntu and its easier to setup (downloading the required modules and packages)

why SQLite ?

the application uses the database for analysis only , it doesnt store processed data or results in the database , beside , the database is offline and only accessed by one user at a time , there fore theres n real need for an online database such as postgres or mysql to integrate with the application

what books did you use  ?
 software engineering by sommervile  
 system analysis by rosenblatt
